    <center><h1>Master Class in Partial Differential Equations and Applications</h1></center>
<h4>Aims and scope</h4>

Modelling with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is widely used in
many scientific fields. It extends from the traditional domains such
as the mechanics, physics and geometry, to new areas, e.g. the
economy, social, and life sciences. The master class offers four
courses, of 5H each, to students in the masters of mathematics and
PhD-students.  The main objective of the masterclass is to provide an
overall picture of the modelling with PDEs and to give some research
perspectives to the participants.
